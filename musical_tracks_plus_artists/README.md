Task:
```
We will do some things differently in this assignment. We will not use a separate "raw" table, we will just use ALTER TABLE statements to remove columns after we don't need them (i.e. we converted them into foreign keys). 
This time we will build a many-to-many relationship using a junction/through/join table between tracks and artists. 
```
